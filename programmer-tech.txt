Main (HMAC class ) : 
User get two options for choose and perform request (generate or verify ). 
The system is waiting until user press 1 or 2 in the Console window and then perform operation . 
For generate : system read the message and key from the messagePath and keyPath and
generate digestFile using HMAC logic with Sha1.
For verify we compare the existing decoded dgest key and new generated . 
If we get the same number we get 
Asscept - else REJECT .

In the same file we have method PerformEncription() that actually include HMAC logic using Sha1 .
implemented according to RFC 2104
